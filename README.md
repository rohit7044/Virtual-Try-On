## Installation

Download the pretrained `SAM 2` checkpoints:

```bash
cd checkpoints
bash download_ckpts.sh
```

Download the pretrained `Grounding DINO` checkpoints:

```bash
cd gdino_checkpoints
bash download_ckpts.sh
```

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Set `CUDA_HOME` environment variable:

Make sure you have [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) installed. It is recommended to use CUDA above 11.8.
```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/path/to/cuda-11.8/
```

Install `Segment Anything 2`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install `Grounding DINO`:

```bash
pip install --no-build-isolation -e grounding_dino
```
